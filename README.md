##  What?

**Edu_mine is a complete e-learning application**, built using Flutter and Firebase, that enables you to sign up for courses, view their content, and track your progress in each course.

##  Why?
I developed this project primarily to sharpen my skills in **building complex UIs**, refining my abilities to **design and manage Backend**-as-a-Service (BaaS) solutions like **Firebase**, and **handle the complex logic** needed to seamlessly integrate both.


##  Features

- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth(Email & Google singin).
- **Remote Database:** Firebase DB.
- **Local Storage:** Caching using SharedPrefrances.
- **Themes:** Dark & Light.
- **Localization:** Arabic & English
- **YouTube Integration:** Integrates YouTube videos using youtube_player_flutter package.
